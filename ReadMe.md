# Fitastic System
## Description
Fitastic is a ML & DL based system that ultilizes the personal workout records with typical feature patterns to recommend a customized workout and a diet plan. Instead of collecting users' height, weight, and other private information, Fitastic regards usersâ€™ heart rate changes as an important indicator to establish model. Calorie is an important input number for Fitastic to understand how much calorie users want to consume and take in, and recommend plans on that basis.

## Functions
* To provide personal workout recommendation based on input calorie
* To provide heart rate prediction during workout, and suggestions on speeding up or slowing down for reaching the target calorie consumption
* To make actual calorie consumption prediction after workout
* To provide personal diet recommendation based on input calorie and selected meal types

## Data
* Over 50 thousand workout records of over 900 users collected from [https://www.endomondo.com/](https://www.endomondo.com/)
* Almost 20 thousand recipes scraped from [https://www.allrecipes.com/](https://www.allrecipes.com/)
